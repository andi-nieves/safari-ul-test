      <strong>EasyBill</strong> (Balance Conversion Program: <ul>
        <li>The EasyTransfer (Balance Transfer) Program allows cardholders to transfer their&nbsp;non-UnionBank Credit
          Card balances to their UnionBank Credit Card and convert it into installment.</li>
        <li>The EasyConvert (Retail Conversion) Program allows cardholders to convert a straight retail transaction on
          their UnionBank Credit Card into installment, depending on their preferred term.</li>

          UnionBank Credit Card and then convert it into installment.</li>
        <li>The EasyBill (Balance Conversion) Program allows cardholders to convert the total or a portion of their
          outstanding retail balance of their latest Statement of Account into installment.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>This facility is open to select UnionBank Credit Cardholders in active status and with good credit standing, and
      may be availed by contacting UnionBank’s customer service channels or through the UnionBank Online App.</li>
    <li>A minimum amount of P3,000 is required to avail of EasyTransfer, EasyConvert, and EasyCash. A minimum amount of
      P5,000 is required to avail of EasyBill.</li>

      sufficient available limit to cover interest charges and fees. For EasyCash, the cardholder may avail up to 80% of
      their available credit limit. If the Available Credit Limit (i.e. Cardholder’s Credit Limit less the outstanding
